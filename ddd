Inquiry Regarding Access to Public SCFR Data

Dear Sir or Madam,

I would like to ask whether it is possible to obtain public SCFR data related to non-life insurance companies that use an internal model.
We are interested in comparing the results of Polish insurers with other entities that also apply such a model.

Alternatively, could you please advise whether the current version of the application allows for comparing a specific insurer with other insurance companies using an internal model?
We are particularly interested in understanding how our company performs in comparison with other EU insurers that have an internal model.

I would be very grateful for any information on this matter.
