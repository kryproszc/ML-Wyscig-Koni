We wanted to first ask what tools are available at EIOPA and then look into what information we would need from the insurer. If my supervisor writes a request to you asking for my addition to the ENW4 Extranet, will that be sufficient? As I understand it, this is a completely different application than the one being developed within the QRT group? I know the R language. I understand that it would be necessary to familiarize ourselves with the specifications of this application and then prepare the data of a potential insurer in such a way that the application recognizes it as an insurer that already has an internal model. Is there a methodological description available explaining how insurers are compared?
