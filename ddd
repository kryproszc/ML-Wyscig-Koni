In the next two weeks I will be on vacation, so I would like to inform you that I won’t be able to attend the upcoming meeting.

I would also like to ask whether I should contact the insurers in Poland (Hestia and InterRisk) myself before my vacation, or if I should wait for information from the group coordinators. So far, no one has contacted me, and I haven’t reached out to anyone either.

I just wanted to make sure if there is anything else I should do before my vacation.
