Inquiry Regarding Access to Public SCFR Data

Dear Sir or Madam,

I would like to ask whether it is possible to obtain public SCFR data related to non-life insurance companies that use an internal model.
We are interested in comparing the results of Polish insurers with other entities that also apply such a model.

I would be very grateful for any information on this matter.
